Terratopia is a project in wich I try to recreate the game Polytopia.

In the end the game isnt gonna be exactly like Polytopia as I change some things along the way but the spirit should be the same.

Please dont steal my code, you are free to check it out, download it, share it (If you do please credit me) but do not reuse my code in your projects unless I give you permission (Also my code isnt really optimized so dont reuse it lol)

Credits:

-Scorpionem (Me) : Developpement of the project, textures, models

-SmartyAlek : Developpement of the project, he rewrote the generation code to try to optimize it.

MCC Island for the textures that I use as temporary textures. I do not share the resource pack as it contains their work.
